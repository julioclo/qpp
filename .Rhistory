# What is DOM?
- Differential object marking (DOM) is a phenomenon that lies at the syntax-semantics interface of at least 300 languages belonging to different language families (Bossong, 1991). Cross-linguistically, DOM is associated with the prominence of animacy and definiteness of direct objects (Aissen, 2003).
- Aissen (2003) follows a functional approach to DOM in several languages and establishes two cross-linguistic scales for animacy and definiteness:
- (1a) Animacy scale: Human > Animate > Inanimate
- (1b) Definiteness scale: Personal pronoun > Proper name > Definite NP > Indef. specific NP > Non-specific NP

# Previous research
- L1 acquisition (Rodríguez-Mondoñedo, 2007)
- L2 acquisition among English speakers (Martoccio, 2012; Nediger, Pires & Guijarro-Fuentes, 2015)
- L2 acquisition among Turkish speakers (Montrul & Gürel, 2015)
- Heritage language acquisition (Montrul & Sanchez-Walker, 2013)
- L1 attrition among speakers of Spanish, Hindi, and Romanian in the U.S. (Montrul, Bhatt & Girju, 2015)
- L3 acquisition (Giancaspro, Halloran, & Iverson, 2015)
- The acquisition of the DOM in Spanish by L2 speakers whose L1 has a DOM system ruled by the same features has not been studied.

# Research question and hypothesis
- RQ: In second language acquisition, does the re-ranking of interpretable features involved in a structure result in cross-linguistic influence?
- H: Yes, in second language acquisition, the re-ranking of the interpretable features involved in a specific structure results in cross-linguistic influence.
- For the current study, I predict that Romanian-speaking advanced L2 speakers of Spanish will show signs of cross-linguistic influence as a result of the re-ranking of the interpretable features involved in the DOM systems of Spanish and Romanian.

# Methods: participants
- 18 Romanian-speaking advanced L2ers of Spanish (age range=21-49, M=30.89, SD=8.04) (years of residence range=7-14, M=9.61, SD=2.57) (age of arrival range=15-35, M=20.72, SD=6.75).
- 17 Spanish-speaking monolinguals (age range=19-50, M=27.65, SD=8.72) participated in the study.
- Both groups live in a monolingual region in Spain. The monolinguals were born in that region.

# Methods: tasks
- Screening tasks:
- DELE (Cuza, Pérez-Leroux & Sánchez, 2013) (in Spanish)
- Multilingual Naming Test (MiNT; Gollan, Weissberger, Runnqvist, Montoya, & Cera, 2012). (in Spanish and Romanian for the bilinguals)
- Experimental tasks:
- Elicited Production Task (EPT) (in Spanish and Romanian for the bilinguals)
- Oral Acceptability Judgment Task (AJT) (in Spanish and Romanian for the bilinguals)

Prompt: Nicolás ha escuchado ______. (profesora).
‘Nicolás listened ______ (teacher).’
Preamble: Nicolás este un băiat rău, dar astăzi s-a comportat bine în clasă pentru că...

# AJT Sample
Preamble: Esas galerías de pintura son muy exclusivas, pero...
‘Those art galleries are very exclusive, but...’
Prompt: David ha visitado a esta.
‘David has visited this one.’
Preamble: Acele cămăși sunt foarte greu de găsit, dar...
‘Those shirts are very difficult to find, but...’
Prompt: Manuel a găsit-o pe aceea.
‘Manuel has found this one’.
Likert scale: 1 (muy raro ‘very odd’), 2 (raro ‘odd’), 3 (ni bien ni mal ‘neither good or bad’), 4 (bien ‘good’), 5 (completamente bien ‘completely good).Expected response: 4 or 5.

# Statistical Analysis
- EPT
- Generalized linear mixed-effects model with a binomial linking function.
- The model included response (use of DOM, non-use of DOM) as the dependent variable, and animacy (animate, inanimate) and definiteness (determiner + noun DP or demonstrative pronoun DP) as fixed factors.
- Significance of main effects and all possible interactions were assessed using hierarchical partitioning of the variance via nested model comparisons.
- AJT
- Generalized linear mixed-effects model with a XXXXXXX linking function.
- The model included response (1 through 5) as the dependent variable, and animacy (animate, inanimate) and definiteness (determiner + noun DP or demonstrative pronoun DP) as fixed factors.
- Significance of main effects and all possible interactions were assessed using hierarchical partitioning of the variance via nested model comparisons.
